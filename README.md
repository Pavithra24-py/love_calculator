# love_calculator
* Used logical operators and if conditions to calucualte love score.
# steps
* first, we have to combine two people name and store under one variable.
* second, make those combines name into lower case using lower() function for TRUE and LOVE.
* don't forget to store the value into another value and sum up them as string (Just do concatenation)
* next, use if conditions to check few things if you want to and I used few logical operators for my exercise.
